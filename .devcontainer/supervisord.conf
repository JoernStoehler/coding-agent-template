# Supervisor configuration for managing background services in coding agent container
# Why supervisor: Provides reliable process management with automatic restarts,
# centralized logging, and easy CLI control (supervisorctl). Better than ad-hoc
# background processes or systemd (which doesn't work well in containers).

[supervisord]
nodaemon=false              ; Why: Run as daemon so our shell scripts can continue
logfile=/var/log/supervisor/supervisord.log
pidfile=/var/run/supervisord.pid
childlogdir=/var/log/supervisor
user=root                   ; Why: Needs root to manage system services and write to /var/log

[supervisorctl]
serverurl=unix:///var/run/supervisor.sock

[unix_http_server]
file=/var/run/supervisor.sock
chmod=0700                  ; Why: Restrict socket access to owner only for security
