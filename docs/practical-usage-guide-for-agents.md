# Practical Usage Guide for Agents

This document provides actionable advice for working with AI agents. An **AI agent** is a system that uses a large language model (LLM) to repeatedly observe, reason, and take actions in an environment. Each recommendation explains what to do, why it works based on agent cognitive architecture, and what practical outcome it achieves.

For a deeper theoretical understanding of agent intelligence, see [Theory of Agents](theory-of-agents.md). This practical guide focuses on what works and why, while the theory document explores the fundamental nature of agent cognition.

## Key Terms

- **Agent**: A system that uses an LLM to repeatedly observe, reason, and take actions
- **Context window**: The text input that an LLM processes (typically 100k-1M tokens)
- **Token**: A piece of text (roughly 1 word = 1.5 tokens, 1 character = 0.25 tokens)
- **Tool**: A function an agent can call (like reading files, running commands, or web searches)
- **Subagent**: A separate agent instance created to handle a specific subtask
- **Action batch**: A group of tool calls that an agent makes in one iteration
- **Stateless**: The agent has no memory between sessions except what's in its context window

## Theoretical Foundations

Before diving into practical advice, it's essential to understand the fundamental nature of agent intelligence. These concepts will be referenced throughout the guide.

### The Agent Loop

Agents operate in a continuous cycle:
1. **Observe** their environment (read files, see command output)
2. **Process** observations through their language model
3. **Decide** on actions based on pattern matching
4. **Execute** those actions (write code, run commands)
5. **Observe** the results and repeat

This loop is **stateless** - each iteration starts fresh with only the accumulated history in the context window.

### Memory Architecture

Unlike humans with specialized memory systems, agents have a simple unified architecture:

- **Context Window** (100k-1M tokens): Serves simultaneously as:
  - Working memory for current task
  - Sensory input buffer for observations
  - Episodic memory of past actions
  - Instruction storage for prompts
- **External Memory**: Information stored in files, databases, or environment
- **No Long-term Memory**: Agents cannot learn or remember between sessions

### Reasoning Characteristics

Agent reasoning differs fundamentally from human reasoning:

| Dimension | Agents | Humans |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Breadth** | Excellent - can process 100s of associations | Limited - 5-9 items |
| **Depth** | Poor - shallow reasoning chains | Excellent - deep sequential logic |
| **Style** | Parallel pattern matching | Serial causal reasoning |
| **Speed** | Fast but shallow | Slow but deep |

This creates the fundamental tradeoff: **Agents have broad, parallel, shallow reasoning while humans have narrow, serial, deep reasoning.**

### Knowledge Taxonomy

Agents possess different depths of knowledge:

1. **Surface Knowledge** (Excellent): Facts, definitions, syntax, memorized patterns
2. **Procedural Knowledge** (Good): Step-by-step processes in familiar domains
3. **Conceptual Knowledge** (Limited): Understanding why things work, causal models
4. **Creative Knowledge** (Very Limited): Generating truly novel solutions

This hierarchy explains why agents excel at routine tasks but struggle with novel problems requiring first-principles reasoning.

### Pattern Matching vs Understanding

Agents operate through **associative pattern matching** rather than causal understanding:
- They recognize patterns from training and match them to current situations
- They cannot derive solutions from first principles
- Their performance is brittle outside the training distribution
- They excel when current context closely matches trained patterns

### Self-Improvement Through Environment

While agents cannot modify their own weights (learn), they can improve effectiveness by:
- **Organizing information** for better retrieval (descriptive names, clear structure)
- **Creating explicit knowledge** (documentation, reasoning traces)
- **Reshaping environment** to match trained patterns (using standard conventions)

This creates a feedback loop where agents make environments more "agent-friendly."

*For a more comprehensive exploration of these theoretical concepts, including the OODA framework hierarchy, fundamental limitations, and academic references, see [Theory of Agents](theory-of-agents.md).*

## Core Principles

### Agents Are Stateless Pattern Matchers

**What this means**: Given the theoretical foundations above, we can summarize: Agents do not learn or remember anything between sessions. They work by matching current situations to patterns seen during training. They have no persistent memory, no ability to improve through experience, and no deep understanding of causation.

**Why this matters**: This stateless pattern-matching nature explains why certain practices work and others fail. Effective agent use requires aligning with this reality rather than expecting human-like learning or reasoning.

### Clarity Is Paramount

With context windows now exceeding 200k tokens, conciseness has become less critical than clarity. The most important consideration for working with agents is **clarity and explicitness**. Since agents process context in constant time regardless of length, optimizing for brevity at the expense of clarity is counterproductive. Always favor:
- Explicit over implicit information
- Detailed explanations over terse commands  
- Redundant clarity over ambiguous brevity

## 1. Task Design

### Keep Tasks Under 2 Hours of Work

**What to do**: Break complex projects into individual tasks that can be completed in under 2 hours.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Each action an agent takes (reading files, running commands, making edits) adds tokens to its context window
- Context windows have a fixed size limit (typically 200k-1M tokens)
- As the context window fills up, there is less space available for new information
- When context gets full, the agent cannot read new files or get new information effectively
- This means agent performance degrades as context window fills up

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Short tasks maintain high performance throughout the entire task
- Long tasks show exponential performance degradation after the context window is approximately 70% full
- Breaking a 8-hour task into 4 two-hour tasks results in much better overall quality

**How to implement this**:
```
Bad example: "Build a complete e-commerce website with user accounts, product catalog, shopping cart, payment processing, and admin dashboard"

Good example: "Implement user authentication module with login, logout, and password reset functionality"

Even better example: "Add password reset functionality to the existing user authentication system"
```

**Why the good examples work**: The good examples are specific, bounded, and can be completed without filling the context window. The bad example would require reading dozens of files, making hundreds of edits, and would quickly exhaust the context window.

### Provide Explicit Success Criteria

**What to do**: Define clear, testable conditions that indicate when the task is complete.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Agents lack implicit understanding of what "done" means for a task
- They pattern-match against examples seen during training
- Training data has widely varying standards for task completion
- Without explicit criteria, agents rely on pattern matching to guess when to stop
- This pattern matching is unreliable and inconsistent

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- With explicit criteria, agents know exactly when to stop working
- Without explicit criteria, agents either over-engineer solutions or stop before the task is truly complete
- Explicit criteria prevent agents from adding unnecessary features or complexity

**How to implement this**:
```
Bad example: "Make the API better"

Good example: "Refactor the API to achieve these specific requirements:
- All error responses return consistent JSON format with 'error', 'message', and 'code' fields
- All responses include a unique 'requestId' field for tracking
- All existing tests continue to pass
- API response time stays under 200ms for all endpoints"
```

**Why the good example works**: The good example provides measurable, testable criteria. The agent can check each criterion and know objectively whether it has been met.

### Use Standard Software Engineering Patterns

**What to do**: Frame tasks using well-known, commonly-used software engineering patterns and approaches.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Agents were trained on millions of code examples from popular projects
- Common patterns like MVC, REST APIs, and standard library usage appear frequently in training data
- Agents have deep, reliable pattern matching for standard approaches
- Novel or custom patterns require reasoning from first principles
- Agents lack conceptual/creative knowledge needed for first-principles reasoning

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Standard patterns unlock the agent's trained knowledge and produce high-quality results
- Novel patterns cause shallow, error-prone responses that often don't work
- Standard patterns are more likely to be maintainable and understandable to human developers

**How to implement this**:
```
Bad example: "Create a custom state synchronization system that manages UI updates through a proprietary event system"

Good example: "Implement state management using Redux pattern with actions, reducers, and a centralized store"
```

**Why the good example works**: Redux is a widely-used pattern that appears in thousands of training examples. The agent has seen many implementations and can produce high-quality Redux code reliably.

### Encourage Step-by-Step Thinking

**What to do**: Explicitly prompt agents to reason through complex problems step by step.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Agents normally use "hidden reasoning tokens" that are not preserved in context
- Hidden reasoning is lost when the agent generates its final response
- Explicit reasoning becomes part of the context window (working memory)
- Preserved reasoning can be referenced in subsequent actions
- Step-by-step reasoning compensates for agents' shallow reasoning depth

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Explicit reasoning improves accuracy from approximately 60% to 85% on complex tasks
- Reasoning traces help debug agent decisions
- Other agents can build on preserved reasoning
- Complex problems are broken down into manageable steps

**How to implement this**:
```
Bad example: "Fix the authentication system"

Good example: "Analyze the authentication system using these steps:
1. First, examine the current authentication flow and identify all components
2. Then, test each component to find where the failure occurs
3. Next, identify the root cause of the failure
4. Finally, implement a fix that addresses the root cause
5. Test the fix to ensure it works correctly"
```

**Why the good example works**: The explicit steps guide the agent through a systematic approach. Each step builds on the previous one, and the reasoning is preserved for future reference.

### Provide Concrete Examples

**What to do**: Include specific, detailed examples of desired outcomes and formats.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Agents excel at pattern matching rather than abstract reasoning (see Knowledge Taxonomy - Surface Knowledge)
- Examples provide precise patterns for agents to match against
- Abstract descriptions require conceptual understanding, which agents lack
- Concrete examples eliminate ambiguity and multiple interpretations
- Pattern matching aligns with agents' broad, shallow reasoning style

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Examples reduce ambiguity and misinterpretation
- First-attempt success rate improves significantly with good examples
- Agents produce outputs that match expectations more closely
- Less iteration and correction is needed

**How to implement this**:
```
Bad example: "Format errors consistently"

Good example: "Format all error responses exactly like this example:
{
  'error': 'ValidationError',
  'message': 'Email field is required',
  'field': 'email',
  'code': 'MISSING_REQUIRED_FIELD',
  'timestamp': '2024-03-15T10:30:00Z'
}

For different error types, follow this pattern:
- 'error': The error class name
- 'message': Human-readable description
- 'field': The specific field that caused the error (if applicable)
- 'code': Machine-readable error code in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- 'timestamp': ISO 8601 timestamp of when the error occurred"
```

**Why the good example works**: The concrete example shows exactly what the output should look like. The pattern explanation makes it clear how to adapt the example to different situations.

### Schedule Long Tasks for Fresh Agents

**What to do**: Start agents on long or context-heavy tasks at the beginning of their session, not after they've already processed other information.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Agent performance is highest when the context window is empty or minimally filled
- Every file read, command run, or observation adds tokens to the context window
- Long tasks require reading many files and making many observations
- Starting with a fresh context window maximizes the available space for the task
- Context gathering at the start of a task can consume significant tokens

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Tasks that require extensive context gathering perform better when started fresh
- Simple but long tasks benefit from having maximum context space available
- Agents can maintain consistent performance throughout longer tasks
- Less likelihood of hitting context limits mid-task

**How to implement this**:
```
Bad approach: 
1. Have agent explore the codebase
2. Answer questions about architecture
3. Then ask it to refactor a large module

Good approach:
1. Create fresh agent specifically for the refactoring task
2. Provide relevant context files upfront if available
3. Let agent use full context window for the refactoring work
```

**Why the good example works**: The dedicated agent has its entire context window available for the complex refactoring task, rather than having it partially filled with exploratory work.

### Use Progressive Disclosure in Prompts

**What to do**: Start with simple, clear instructions. Add complexity and edge cases only when the basic approach is established.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Agents process information sequentially and build understanding incrementally
- Complex instructions presented all at once can overwhelm pattern matching
- Simple initial patterns are easier to match and execute correctly
- Additional complexity can be layered on top of successful simple patterns
- This aligns with how agents naturally process information - shallow first, then deeper

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Higher success rate on first attempts
- Clearer execution of core requirements before handling edge cases
- Easier debugging when issues arise - you know which layer failed
- More predictable agent behavior

**How to implement this**:
```
Bad example: "Create a user authentication system that handles OAuth2, SAML, 
username/password, supports 2FA via SMS/TOTP/WebAuthn, implements rate limiting,
logs all attempts, prevents timing attacks, and works with PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite"

Good example: 
"Create a basic username/password authentication system.

Core requirements:
1. User registration with email/password
2. Login endpoint that returns a JWT token
3. Token validation middleware

Once that's working, we'll add:
- OAuth2 support
- Rate limiting
- Additional security features"
```

**Why the good example works**: The agent can focus on getting the core functionality correct first. Additional features can be added incrementally once the foundation is solid.

### Create Simple Negative Examples (With Caution)

**What to do**: When necessary, show what NOT to do - but keep negative examples extremely simple and clearly marked.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Agents use pattern matching without understanding - they don't inherently know "good" from "bad"
- Clearly labeled negative examples can help establish boundaries
- Complex negative examples risk teaching bad patterns (surface knowledge problem)
- Simple, obvious anti-patterns are less likely to be adopted
- The "NOT" or "WRONG" labels create strong associative signals for pattern matching

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Prevents common mistakes by explicitly showing what to avoid
- Clarifies ambiguous requirements by showing the wrong interpretation
- Helps agents understand subtle distinctions
- Reduces iterations fixing predictable errors

**How to implement this**:
```
Good example of using negative examples:
"CORRECT way to handle errors:
try:
    result = risky_operation()
except SpecificException as e:
    logger.error(f"Operation failed: {e}")
    return None

WRONG way (DO NOT DO THIS):
try:
    result = risky_operation()
except:
    pass  # Never catch all exceptions silently!"

Bad example of negative examples:
"Here's a poorly architected authentication system:
[50 lines of complex, subtly flawed code]"
```

**Why the good example works**: The negative example is trivially wrong and clearly labeled. The bad example of negative examples is too complex and might teach subtle anti-patterns.

### Consider Test-Driven Development

**What to do**: Write tests before implementation, or provide test cases as executable specifications for the agent.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Tests provide concrete, verifiable success criteria
- Agents can repeatedly run tests to verify their work
- Test cases serve as precise specifications of expected behavior
- The red-green cycle provides clear feedback loops
- Tests encode requirements in executable form

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Agents know exactly when they've succeeded
- Less ambiguity about edge cases - they're encoded in tests
- Automatic verification reduces human review burden
- Changes can be made with confidence that tests still pass

**How to implement this**:
```
Good example:
"Implement a function to calculate fibonacci numbers. Here are the test cases:

def test_fibonacci():
    assert fibonacci(0) == 0
    assert fibonacci(1) == 1
    assert fibonacci(5) == 5
    assert fibonacci(10) == 55
    assert fibonacci(-1) raises ValueError
    assert fibonacci(1.5) raises TypeError

Make all these tests pass."

Bad example:
"Create a fibonacci function that handles edge cases properly"
```

**Why the good example works**: The tests explicitly define all expected behavior including edge cases. The agent can verify its implementation works correctly by running the tests.

## 2. Context and Information Management

### Front-Load Critical Information

**What to do**: Put the most important information at the beginning of prompts, files, and documentation.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- LLM attention mechanisms give more weight to tokens that appear earlier in the input
- Information in the middle of very long contexts receives less attention
- The "recency bias" effect means recent information gets more attention than middle information
- When context windows are nearly full, early information is more likely to be retained

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Critical information at the start gets properly considered during decision-making
- Important information buried in the middle of long contexts often gets missed or ignored
- Front-loading reduces the chance of agents missing crucial requirements or constraints

**How to implement this**:
```
Bad example: 
[500 lines of code]
// Important: This system uses custom error handling - see handleError() function

Good example:
// CRITICAL: This system uses custom error handling via handleError() function
// All errors must be processed through this function, not thrown directly
// See examples on lines 45-60 below
[500 lines of code]
```

**Why the good example works**: The critical information is immediately visible and includes specific references. The agent will process this information first and can refer back to it when making decisions.

### Document All Conclusions Explicitly

**What to do**: Write down the results of any complex reasoning, investigation, or debugging in permanent files.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Agents have no long-term memory - only what's in the context window
- Complex reasoning happens in temporary "reasoning tokens" that are not preserved
- When an agent session ends, all insights and conclusions are lost
- New agent instances start with empty working memory
- External memory (files) is the only way to preserve knowledge between sessions

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Explicit documentation preserves insights for future agent instances
- Prevents agents from re-discovering the same information repeatedly
- Enables agents to build on previous work instead of starting from scratch
- Reduces time spent on repeated investigation and debugging

**How to implement this**:
```
After a debugging session, immediately add to README.md or a dedicated file:

## Known Issues and Solutions

### Database Connection Failures (Discovered 2024-03-15)
**Problem**: Database connections fail intermittently with "SSL handshake failed" error
**Root Cause**: SSL_MODE environment variable not set
**Solution**: Set SSL_MODE=require in .env file
**Files affected**: db-config.js, connection-pool.js
**Test command**: npm run test:db-connection
```

**Why this works**: The documentation is explicit, specific, and includes all relevant details. A future agent can read this and immediately understand the problem and solution without re-investigating.

### Write Navigation Breadcrumbs Throughout Code

**What to do**: Add comments that help future agents (or yourself in a new session) understand code structure and navigate efficiently.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Agents have perfect recall within their context window but zero memory between sessions
- Navigation comments leverage agents' associative pattern matching
- Breadcrumbs reduce the need to read entire files to understand structure
- Comments about "why" compensate for agents' limited conceptual knowledge
- These markers help agents match queries to relevant code sections

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Future agents can quickly locate relevant code sections
- Less time spent reading irrelevant code parts
- Better understanding of code relationships and dependencies
- Reduced context window consumption during navigation

**How to implement this**:
```
Good example:
# authentication_service.py
"""Handles user authentication and session management.

Related files:
- models/user.py - User model definition
- utils/jwt_handler.py - JWT token generation
- middleware/auth_middleware.py - Request authentication
"""

class AuthService:
    # Main entry point for login - called by /api/login endpoint
    def authenticate_user(self, email, password):
        # Validation happens in validate_credentials()
        # Password hashing uses bcrypt (see security_config.py)
        ...

Bad example:
# auth.py
class AuthService:
    def authenticate_user(self, email, password):
        # login function
        ...
```

**Why the good example works**: The breadcrumbs explicitly state relationships, entry points, and cross-references. Future agents can navigate directly to relevant code without exploring.

### Create Architecture Decision Records

**What to do**: Document the "why" behind architectural choices, constraints, and design patterns in your codebase.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Agents have good procedural knowledge but limited conceptual knowledge
- Without context, agents may violate architectural constraints unknowingly
- Decision records create explicit connections between problems and solutions
- The "why" compensates for agents' inability to derive solutions from first principles
- File-scoped decisions should be documented in file headers

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Agents make decisions consistent with existing architecture
- Reduces violations of design principles and constraints
- Prevents agents from "fixing" intentional design choices
- Enables agents to extend architecture appropriately

**How to implement this**:
```
Good example (in file header):
# payment_processor.py
"""Handles payment processing with external providers.

Architecture Decisions:
- Uses Strategy pattern to support multiple payment providers (ADR-001)
- Async processing to handle provider timeouts gracefully (ADR-002)  
- All amounts stored as integers (cents) to avoid float precision issues
- Retries handled by queue system, not in this module (see: queue_handler.py)

Constraints:
- Never log full credit card numbers (PCI compliance)
- All provider calls must have 30s timeout
- Failed payments must not be retried here
"""

Bad example:
# payment_processor.py
# Processes payments
```

**Why the good example works**: Future agents understand not just what the code does, but why it's structured this way. They won't accidentally introduce float arithmetic or add retry logic where it doesn't belong.

### Consider Typed Comments (Use Sparingly)

**What to do**: Use structured comment prefixes like ASSUMPTION:, CONSTRAINT:, or DECISION: when they add clarity, but don't overuse them.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Typed prefixes create stronger pattern matching signals than plain text
- Agents can more easily search for specific types of information
- Bold patterns help ensure important information isn't missed
- Structure helps maintain consistency across the codebase
- But overuse reduces their effectiveness and clutters code

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Easier to find specific types of documentation
- Important constraints and assumptions are less likely to be missed
- Maintains good documentation practices
- Avoids comment clutter that reduces readability

**How to implement this**:
```
Good use of typed comments:
# user_service.py

# ASSUMPTION: User emails are unique across the system
# CONSTRAINT: Password must be hashed with bcrypt (security requirement)
# DECISION: Cache user objects for 5 minutes to reduce DB load (ADR-004)

class UserService:
    def create_user(self, email, password):
        # SECURITY: Never log raw passwords
        hashed = bcrypt.hash(password)
        ...

Bad overuse:
# NOTE: This is a class
# TODO: This needs to be implemented
# INFO: This method does something
# COMMENT: Here's a comment about a comment
```

**Why this works**: The good example uses typed comments only for critical information that could affect implementation decisions. Natural language works fine for most comments - typed prefixes should highlight only the most important constraints and decisions.

### Use Highly Descriptive File Names

**What to do**: Use long, explicit file names that clearly describe the file's content and purpose.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Agents must decide whether to read files based primarily on file names
- Reading files consumes context window tokens
- Agents use file names to predict whether a file contains relevant information
- Short or vague file names require reading the file to understand its purpose
- Reading unnecessary files wastes context window space

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Descriptive names reduce unnecessary file reads by 50-70%
- Agents can find relevant files more quickly
- Context window space is preserved for actual work instead of exploration
- Agents make better decisions about which files to read

**How to implement this**:
```
Bad examples: 
- utils.js
- helpers.py
- core.ts
- main.go

Good examples:
- user-authentication-utilities.js
- database-connection-helpers.py
- payment-processing-core.ts
- http-server-main.go
```

**Why the good examples work**: Each name immediately tells the agent what functionality the file contains. The agent can decide whether to read the file without opening it first.

### Flatten Directory Structure

**What to do**: Avoid deep directory nesting. Use maximum 1-2 levels of directories.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Each directory level requires a separate tool call to explore
- Deep nesting multiplies the number of actions needed to find files
- Each tool call consumes context window tokens
- Agents must explore directories sequentially, not in parallel
- The exploration process is linear: list directory → examine contents → list subdirectory → repeat

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Flat structures reduce file search time from O(n*d) to O(n) where d is directory depth
- Agents spend less time exploring and more time working
- Fewer tool calls means more context window space for actual work
- Files are found more quickly and reliably

**How to implement this**:
```
Bad example (deep nesting):
src/
  components/
    user/
      profile/
        settings/
          privacy/
            PrivacyToggle.jsx
            PrivacyForm.jsx
            PrivacyValidator.js

Good example (flat structure):
src/
  components/
    UserPrivacyToggle.jsx
    UserPrivacyForm.jsx
    UserPrivacyValidator.js
```

**Why the good example works**: All files are immediately visible. The agent can see all components in one directory listing instead of navigating through 5 levels of directories.

### Colocate Related Information

**What to do**: Put related code, tests, documentation, and types in the same directory.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Agents retrieve information in chunks based on directory listings
- When an agent reads one file, it often loads nearby files into context
- Related files in the same directory are discovered together
- Agents can see the complete context for a feature in one directory listing
- This reduces the need for cross-directory searches

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Colocation ensures agents get complete context about a feature in one retrieval
- Reduces the number of directory explorations needed
- Prevents agents from missing related files
- Makes it easier to understand feature boundaries and responsibilities

**How to implement this**:
```
Good example:
user-authentication/
  user-auth.js          # Main implementation
  user-auth.test.js     # Tests
  user-auth.md          # Documentation
  user-auth-types.ts    # Type definitions
  user-auth-config.json # Configuration
```

**Why this works**: Everything related to user authentication is in one place. An agent working on authentication can see all relevant files immediately and understand the complete context.

### Use Anchor Points in Long Files

**What to do**: Add strategic comments and section markers in long files to help agents navigate and maintain attention on important sections.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Attention mechanisms give different weights to different parts of the input
- Anchor points create strong associative connections to specific sections
- Comments with keywords make sections more relevant for specific queries
- Section markers help agents understand file structure without reading everything
- Important sections can be highlighted to increase their relevance weight

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Agents can jump directly to relevant sections in long files
- Important code sections get appropriate attention
- Less time spent reading irrelevant parts of files
- Better comprehension of file organization

**How to implement this**:
```
Good example:
# data_processor.py (2000+ lines)

# ============= CRITICAL SECURITY SECTION =============
# This section handles user input validation
# IMPORTANT: All user input must be sanitized here
# Related: security_policy.md, input_validator.py

def validate_user_input(data):
    # ... validation logic ...

# ============= PERFORMANCE CRITICAL SECTION =============
# These algorithms are optimized for speed
# WARNING: Changes here impact system performance
# Benchmark before modifying: benchmarks/data_processing.py

def process_large_dataset(dataset):
    # ... optimized algorithm ...

Bad example:
# data_processor.py
def validate_user_input(data):
    # validates input
    ...
# 2000 more lines of code...
```

**Why the good example works**: The anchor points make it easy for agents to find specific sections. The CRITICAL/WARNING keywords increase attention weight, and the Related comments provide navigation hints.

### Delete Outdated Information Immediately

**What to do**: Remove or update stale documentation, comments, and code as soon as it becomes outdated.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Agents cannot distinguish between current and outdated information
- Agents treat all text in their context as equally valid and current
- Outdated information competes with current information for attention
- Agents may choose to follow outdated patterns or instructions
- There is no built-in mechanism for agents to detect information age or validity

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Outdated information causes agents to make decisions based on false or obsolete information
- Agents may implement deprecated patterns or use removed APIs
- Conflicting information confuses agents and reduces decision quality
- Clean, current information improves agent reliability and accuracy

**How to implement this**:
```
When refactoring code, immediately:
1. Delete the old implementation completely
2. Update all references to point to the new implementation
3. Fix all documentation to reflect the new approach
4. Remove all outdated comments and TODO items
5. Update any configuration files or environment variables
```

**Why this works**: Complete removal eliminates confusion. The agent only sees current, valid information and cannot accidentally use outdated approaches.

### Use Semantic Versioning in Documentation

**What to do**: Include explicit version numbers, dates, or API versions in documentation to help agents identify current information.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Agents cannot detect information age from context alone
- All documentation appears equally valid to an agent regardless of when it was written
- Version numbers create explicit signals about information currency
- Agents can match version numbers to determine compatibility
- Dates provide clear temporal context for decision-making

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Prevents agents from using outdated API patterns or deprecated features
- Enables agents to select appropriate documentation for the current codebase
- Reduces errors from following old tutorials or examples
- Makes it clear when documentation needs updating

**How to implement this**:
```
Good example:
# Authentication Guide (v2.0 - Updated 2024-03-15)
# Compatible with: AppFramework 3.x, Python 3.10+

## Current Authentication Method (Since v2.0)
Use JWT tokens with the following pattern...

## Deprecated (v1.x - Remove by 2024-06-01)
The session-based auth is deprecated. Do not use.

Bad example:
# Authentication Guide
Here's how authentication works...
```

**Why the good example works**: Version numbers and dates make it explicitly clear which information is current. The agent can match these against the project's actual versions to ensure compatibility.

### Use Subagents for Complex Research

**What to do**: Create separate agent instances to handle research, exploration, and investigation tasks.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Complex searches and explorations generate many failed attempts and dead ends
- These failed attempts fill up the main agent's working memory (context window)
- A full context window prevents the agent from reading new files or getting new information
- Subagents start with fresh, empty working memory
- Subagents can explore extensively without affecting the main agent's context
- Subagents return only the useful results, not the failed attempts

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Subagents can explore 10x more possibilities without degrading main task performance
- Main agent context remains clean and focused on the primary task
- Research can be done in parallel with main development work
- Complex investigations don't consume main agent resources

**How to implement this**:
```
Bad example: "Find and fix all SQL injection vulnerabilities in the application"

Good example: 
1. Create subagent with task: "Research: Find all locations in the codebase where database queries are constructed. Return a list of file names and line numbers."
2. Main agent receives clean list of query locations
3. Main agent task: "Fix SQL injection vulnerabilities in these specific locations: [list from subagent]"
```

**Why the good example works**: The subagent does the messy exploration work and returns only the useful results. The main agent can focus on the actual fixes without its context being filled with search attempts.

### Batch Operations When Possible

**What to do**: Combine multiple independent operations into single action batches.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Each individual action has processing overhead (prompt processing, response generation, tool execution)
- The overhead time is fixed regardless of action complexity
- Batching amortizes the fixed overhead across multiple operations
- Network latency occurs once per batch instead of once per action
- Context window updates happen once per batch instead of once per action

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Batching 10 file reads reduces execution time from 30 seconds to 5 seconds
- Fewer context window updates means more space for actual work
- Reduced network traffic and API calls
- Better resource utilization and throughput

**How to implement this**:
```
Bad example (sequential operations):
1. Read file1.js
2. Read file2.js  
3. Read file3.js
4. Read file4.js
5. Read file5.js

Good example (batched operations):
1. Read files: file1.js, file2.js, file3.js, file4.js, file5.js (in parallel)
```

**Why the good example works**: All five files are read in one operation with one set of overhead. The results are available simultaneously for processing.

### Batch Similar Refactoring Across Files

**What to do**: When making the same change across multiple files (like renaming a function or changing a pattern), do all files in one agent session rather than sequentially.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Agents excel at pattern matching when they can see multiple examples
- Having all instances visible in the same context improves consistency
- The agent can detect edge cases by seeing all variations at once
- Pattern recognition works better with more examples in context
- Cross-file dependencies become visible when all files are present

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- More consistent refactoring across all files
- Better detection of edge cases and variations
- Reduced chance of missing instances
- Fewer errors from incomplete pattern matching

**How to implement this**:
```
Bad approach:
1. "Rename getUserById to findUserById in auth.js"
2. "Now rename getUserById to findUserById in users.js"  
3. "Now rename getUserById to findUserById in admin.js"

Good approach:
"Rename all instances of getUserById to findUserById across these files:
- src/auth.js
- src/users.js
- src/admin.js
- tests/user.test.js

Show me all changes before applying them."
```

**Why the good example works**: The agent sees all contexts where the function appears, can identify patterns in how it's used, and ensures consistent renaming including in test files that might have been forgotten.

### Filter Large Outputs

**What to do**: Use command-line tools like grep, head, tail, and pipes to reduce the size of command outputs.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Large command outputs consume many tokens in the context window
- Each token used for output is unavailable for reasoning or new information
- Full outputs often contain mostly irrelevant information
- Filtering extracts only the relevant portions
- Smaller outputs leave more context space for productive work

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Filtering can preserve 50,000+ tokens for actual work instead of storing irrelevant output
- Agents can process information more efficiently
- Less scrolling and searching through large outputs
- Context window usage is optimized for relevant information

**How to implement this**:
```
Bad example: cat large-log-file.log (outputs 50,000 lines)

Good examples:
- grep ERROR large-log-file.log | tail -100 (show last 100 error lines)
- head -50 large-log-file.log (show first 50 lines)
- tail -f large-log-file.log | grep "authentication" (follow log for auth events)
- ls -la | grep ".js$" (show only JavaScript files)
```

**Why the good examples work**: Each command returns only the relevant information, typically reducing output from thousands of lines to dozens of lines.

### Create Information Hierarchies

**What to do**: Build index files, summaries, and overview documents that help agents understand large codebases quickly.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Agents must build mental models of codebases from scratch in each session
- Reading every file to understand structure is inefficient and fills context
- Precomputed summaries provide instant orientation without exploration
- Hierarchical information lets agents drill down only where needed
- Overview documents serve as maps for navigation

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Reduces initial "exploration" phase from 20+ actions to 2-3 actions
- Agents can quickly understand codebase structure and find relevant files
- Less time spent reading irrelevant files
- Faster task completion and better results

**How to implement this**:
```
Create PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md:

# Project Structure Overview

## Core Directories
- `/api` - REST API endpoints (Express.js framework)
  - Main file: server.js
  - Routes: user-routes.js, product-routes.js, order-routes.js
  
- `/auth` - Authentication system (JWT + OAuth)
  - Main file: auth-middleware.js
  - Login: login-handler.js
  - Tokens: jwt-utils.js
  
- `/database` - Database layer (PostgreSQL + Sequelize)
  - Models: user-model.js, product-model.js, order-model.js
  - Migrations: /migrations directory
  - Config: database-config.js
  
- `/frontend` - React.js user interface
  - Components: /components directory
  - Pages: /pages directory
  - State: /redux directory
  
- `/tests` - Test suites (Jest framework)
  - API tests: /api-tests directory
  - Frontend tests: /frontend-tests directory
  - Integration tests: /integration-tests directory

## Key Files
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `.env.example` - Environment variables template
- `README.md` - Setup and usage instructions
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment procedures
```

**Why this works**: An agent can read this overview and immediately understand the codebase structure, key files, and where to find specific functionality.

### Preload Context for Complex Tasks

**What to do**: When you know which files an agent will need, provide them upfront rather than letting the agent discover them gradually.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Context preloading "spans the knowledge tree" of the codebase early
- Initial broad context helps agents make better navigation decisions
- Reduces exploration time and failed file searches
- Seeds the agent's pattern matching with relevant examples
- Preserves context space by avoiding dead-end explorations

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Reduces task completion time by 30-50% for complex tasks
- Better initial understanding leads to higher quality solutions
- Less context wasted on exploring irrelevant files
- More focused and efficient agent work

**How to implement this**:
```
Bad approach:
"Fix the authentication bug"
[Agent spends 20+ actions exploring to find auth files]

Good approach:
"Fix the authentication bug. Here are the relevant files:
- src/auth/login_handler.py (main authentication logic)
- src/models/user.py (user model)
- src/utils/jwt_validator.py (token validation)
- tests/test_auth.py (existing tests showing expected behavior)

The bug occurs when users try to login with expired tokens."
```

**Why the good example works**: The agent starts with all necessary context loaded. It can immediately understand the relationships between files and focus on solving the actual problem rather than finding the relevant code.

### Write Explicit Interface Documentation

**What to do**: Create separate interface documentation files (.d.ts, .md, or similar) that describe component APIs without requiring agents to read implementation code.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Reading implementation code consumes significant context tokens
- Interfaces provide the essential "what" without the complex "how"
- Agents can understand component boundaries without parsing logic
- Clean interfaces are easier to pattern match against
- High-level documentation enables faster comprehension

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Agents can understand system architecture without reading all code
- Faster identification of which components to modify
- Clearer understanding of component contracts and dependencies
- Reduced context consumption for architecture comprehension

**How to implement this**:
```
Good example (auth-service.d.ts or auth-service.md):
interface AuthService {
  /**
   * Authenticates user and returns JWT token
   * @throws {InvalidCredentialsError} if credentials are wrong
   * @throws {UserLockedError} if account is locked
   */
  login(email: string, password: string): Promise<{token: string}>
  
  /**
   * Validates JWT token and returns user info
   * @throws {InvalidTokenError} if token is invalid/expired
   */
  validateToken(token: string): Promise<User>
  
  /**
   * Logs out user and invalidates token
   */
  logout(token: string): Promise<void>
}

Bad example:
"See auth-service.js for the API"
[Agent must read 500+ lines of implementation to understand the interface]
```

**Why the good example works**: The agent immediately understands what the service does, what methods are available, what errors to handle, and what types to expect - all without reading any implementation code.

## 3. Error Recovery

### Expect Stochastic Failures

**What to do**: Design systems assuming that agent actions will occasionally fail randomly, even when the input is correct.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Large language models are probabilistic systems, not deterministic systems
- The same input can produce different outputs due to randomness in the generation process
- Each action has a small probability of failure (typically 2-5%)
- When actions are chained together, failure probabilities multiply
- A sequence of 10 actions with 5% individual failure rate has a 40% chance of overall failure

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Systems designed with failure expectation are more robust and reliable
- Unexpected failures don't derail the entire task
- Recovery mechanisms can handle random failures automatically
- User experience is more consistent and predictable

**How to implement this**:
```
Design patterns for handling stochastic failures:
1. Add retry logic for critical operations (try 3 times before failing)
2. Validate outputs before proceeding to next step
3. Design rollback procedures for failed operations
4. Keep all operations idempotent (safe to repeat)
5. Use checkpoints to save progress at key stages
```

**Why this works**: These patterns assume failure will happen and provide mechanisms to handle it gracefully. The system can recover from random failures without human intervention.

### Provide Specific Error Context

**What to do**: When agents encounter errors, provide detailed, specific error messages that include context about what was being attempted.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Agents learn to self-correct by matching error patterns in their context
- Vague error messages don't provide useful patterns to match against
- Specific errors enable pattern matching against similar problems in training data
- Detailed context helps agents understand what went wrong and why
- Error patterns in context guide future actions to avoid similar mistakes

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Specific errors enable agents to self-correct and try alternative approaches
- Vague errors cause agents to repeat the same mistakes
- Good error messages reduce the number of failed attempts
- Debugging becomes faster and more effective

**How to implement this**:
```
Bad example: "Command failed"

Good example: "Command 'npm test' failed with exit code 1.
Error output: 'Cannot find module './user-auth'
Command was run from directory: /project/src/
Likely cause: Missing import statement or file 'user-auth.js' not created yet
Suggested fix: Check that file 'user-auth.js' exists or create it first"
```

**Why the good example works**: The specific error provides actionable information. The agent can pattern-match against similar "Cannot find module" errors and understand what steps to take next.

### Reset Context When Agents Get Stuck

**What to do**: Start a fresh agent instance when the current agent becomes confused or repeatedly fails.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Failed attempts accumulate in the agent's context window
- Each failure creates a pattern that biases future actions toward similar failures
- Agents learn from their immediate context, including failed attempts
- A context full of failures makes the agent more likely to fail again
- Fresh context removes the failure bias and negative patterns

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Fresh agents often succeed immediately on tasks where previous agents failed
- Removes the negative feedback loop of repeated failures
- Prevents agents from getting stuck in unproductive patterns
- Allows for different approaches to the same problem

**When to reset context (specific signs)**:
```
Reset when you observe:
- Same error message appearing 3 or more times
- Agent taking contradictory actions (creating then deleting the same file)
- Context window over 150,000 tokens (approximately 70% full)
- Agent showing circular reasoning or repetitive behavior
- Agent asking for the same information multiple times
```

**How to reset**: Create a new agent instance with a clean summary of what needs to be done, excluding the failed attempts and error history.

### Make Frequent Commits with Clear Messages

**What to do**: Commit changes frequently (every 30-60 minutes of work) with clear, descriptive commit messages following conventional commit format.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Agents cannot mentally "undo" changes - they need physical rollback points
- Frequent commits create restoration points if something goes wrong
- Clear commit messages help future agents understand what was changed and why
- Conventional commit format creates searchable, parseable history
- Git history becomes a form of persistent memory across sessions

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Easy rollback when agents make mistakes
- Clear understanding of project evolution
- Ability to bisect and find when issues were introduced
- Better context for future agents understanding the codebase
- Protection against accidental deletions or corruptions

**How to implement this**:
```
Good commit practices:
feat: add user authentication with JWT tokens
fix: prevent SQL injection in search queries
refactor: extract email validation to utility function
docs: update API documentation for v2 endpoints
test: add integration tests for payment flow

Bad commit practices:
"updates"
"fix stuff"
"WIP"
"changes"
```

**Why this works**: Each commit message clearly states what changed. The conventional format (feat/fix/docs/test/refactor) makes it easy to understand the type of change. Future agents can quickly understand project history.

## 4. Multi-Agent Coordination

### Assign Independent Components to Each Agent

**What to do**: Divide work so that each agent works on components that don't share state or require coordination.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Agents cannot coordinate in real-time during their work
- Agents cannot see what other agents are currently doing
- Shared state changes create conflicts when multiple agents modify the same data
- Agents have no mechanism to negotiate or resolve conflicts
- Independence eliminates the need for coordination

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Independent agents can work in parallel without stepping on each other
- No conflicts or overwrites between agents
- Maximum parallelization and efficiency
- Reduced complexity in task management

**How to implement this**:
```
Good division (independent components):
- Agent 1: Frontend user interface components
- Agent 2: Backend API endpoint implementations  
- Agent 3: Database schema and migration scripts
- Agent 4: Authentication and authorization system

Bad division (shared components):
- Agent 1: First half of user registration feature
- Agent 2: Second half of user registration feature
- Agent 3: User registration error handling
- Agent 4: User registration testing
```

**Why the good division works**: Each agent works on a completely separate system component. There are no shared files or overlapping responsibilities.

### Use Explicit Message Passing

**What to do**: Have agents communicate through explicit, structured messages rather than sharing files or memory.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Messages become part of the recipient agent's context window
- Messages provide clear, unambiguous communication
- Shared memory requires constant checking and polling
- Messages create a clear record of what was communicated
- Message content is processed directly by the recipient agent

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Explicit communication prevents missed updates and misunderstandings
- Clear record of inter-agent communication for debugging
- No race conditions or timing issues
- Agents can act immediately on received information

**How to implement this**:
```
Agent 1 completes work and sends message:
"User authentication API implementation complete.

Available endpoints:
- POST /api/auth/login (email, password) → returns JWT token
- POST /api/auth/logout (token) → invalidates token  
- POST /api/auth/register (email, password, name) → creates user
- GET /api/auth/profile (token) → returns user profile

Error codes:
- 401: Invalid credentials
- 409: User already exists
- 422: Validation failed

All endpoints tested and working. Ready for frontend integration."

Agent 2 receives message and can immediately start building UI components for these specific endpoints.
```

**Why this works**: The message contains all information needed for Agent 2 to start work immediately. No guessing or exploration required.

### Plan Multi-Agent Work Division Before Starting

**What to do**: Design the complete division of work and responsibilities before creating any agents.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Agents cannot dynamically negotiate or change their responsibilities
- Unclear boundaries cause duplicate work or missing work
- Agents will complete their assigned tasks regardless of overlap
- No mechanism exists for agents to coordinate workload changes
- Planning must happen before agents start working

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Clear boundaries enable true parallel execution
- No duplicate or missing work
- Agents can work efficiently without confusion
- Better overall coordination and results

**How to implement this**:
```
Before creating agents, document:

1. Component boundaries:
   - User Interface: All React components and styling
   - API Layer: All Express.js routes and middleware
   - Database: All models, migrations, and database logic
   - Authentication: All auth-related functionality

2. Interface contracts:
   - API endpoints and their specifications
   - Database schema and relationships
   - Authentication tokens and permissions
   - Error handling and response formats

3. Agent assignments:
   - Agent A: Responsible for User Interface component
   - Agent B: Responsible for API Layer component
   - Agent C: Responsible for Database component
   - Agent D: Responsible for Authentication component

4. Communication plan:
   - Each agent reports completion with interface specifications
   - Integration happens after all components are complete
   - Testing agent validates entire system integration
```

**Why this works**: Clear planning eliminates ambiguity and enables agents to work independently while producing compatible results.

### Create HANDOFF.md Files for Agent Transitions

**What to do**: When one agent completes work that another agent will continue, create a HANDOFF.md file documenting the current state, key decisions, and next steps.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Agents are completely stateless between sessions
- New agents have no knowledge of previous agents' work or reasoning
- HANDOFF files create explicit knowledge transfer between agents
- Structured handoffs preserve critical context and decisions
- Without handoffs, agents must rediscover everything from scratch

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Smooth transitions between agents working on related tasks
- No loss of critical information or context
- Reduced duplication of effort
- Clear starting points for continuation work
- Better overall project coherence

**How to implement this**:
```
Good HANDOFF.md example:
# Authentication Module Handoff
## Completed by: auth-implementation-agent
## Date: 2024-03-15
## Status: Core implementation complete, needs testing

### What was implemented:
- JWT-based authentication (see: src/auth/jwt_handler.py)
- User login/logout endpoints (see: src/api/auth_routes.py)
- Session management with Redis (see: src/auth/session_store.py)

### Key decisions made:
- Chose JWT over sessions for stateless authentication
- 24-hour token expiry (configurable in config/auth.yaml)
- Refresh tokens stored in httpOnly cookies

### Current state:
- All endpoints implemented and manually tested
- Unit tests written for JWT handler
- Integration tests still needed

### Next steps for testing-agent:
1. Write integration tests for login/logout flow
2. Add tests for token refresh mechanism
3. Test error cases (invalid tokens, expired tokens)
4. Verify Redis session cleanup

### Known issues:
- Rate limiting not yet implemented
- Need to add password reset flow

### Relevant files:
- Implementation: src/auth/
- Configuration: config/auth.yaml
- Existing tests: tests/unit/test_jwt.py
```

**Why this works**: The handoff provides complete context for the next agent. It documents what exists, why decisions were made, what still needs doing, and where to find everything. The next agent can start productive work immediately.

## 5. Project Management for Agent Teams

### Use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**What to do**: Document significant architectural choices in a standardized format that agents can understand and reference.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- ADRs provide the "why" that agents cannot derive from code alone
- Agents can reference ADRs to understand constraints and rationale
- Standardized format makes information easily parseable
- Creates persistent external memory of architectural knowledge
- Prevents agents from violating design decisions through ignorance

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Consistent architectural decisions across agent work
- Reduced architectural drift over time
- Clear rationale for future modifications
- Better agent understanding of system constraints

**How to implement this**:
```markdown
# ADR-001: Use Event Sourcing for Audit Trail

## Status
Accepted (2024-03-15)

## Context
- Need complete audit trail for compliance
- Must track all state changes
- System needs to support temporal queries

## Decision
Use event sourcing pattern with append-only event store.

## Consequences
Positive:
- Complete audit trail by design
- Can replay events to any point in time
- Natural fit for CQRS pattern

Negative:
- Increased storage requirements
- More complex than CRUD
- Eventually consistent reads

## References
- Event Store: src/infrastructure/event-store/
- Event Handlers: src/domain/events/
```

**Why this works**: The ADR explicitly states context agents wouldn't know, documents the decision and its trade-offs, and provides clear references to implementation. Future agents will understand why event sourcing was chosen and won't accidentally implement direct database updates.

### Adapt Agile Sprints for Agent Teams

**What to do**: Structure agent work in time-boxed iterations with clear goals and deliverables.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Agents work best with bounded, clear objectives
- Sprint structure provides natural checkpoints
- Time-boxing prevents endless exploration
- Regular integration reduces conflicts
- Human review cycles align with sprint boundaries

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Predictable delivery of features
- Regular integration of agent work
- Clear progress tracking
- Manageable complexity per iteration

**How to implement this**:
```markdown
## Sprint 1: Authentication System (Week of 2024-03-15)

### Sprint Goal
Implement secure user authentication with JWT tokens

### Agent Assignments
- auth-api-agent: Create login/logout endpoints
- auth-db-agent: Design user schema and sessions
- auth-test-agent: Write integration tests
- auth-docs-agent: Generate API documentation

### Definition of Done
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] API documented
- [ ] Deployed to staging

### Daily Coordination
- Morning: Check agent progress via mail
- Afternoon: Address blockers
- Evening: Review completed work
```

**Why this works**: Each agent has a clear, bounded task. The sprint structure ensures regular integration and review. The definition of done prevents incomplete work from being considered finished.

### Implement Kanban for Agent Task Flow

**What to do**: Use visual task boards to track agent work through defined stages.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Visual boards match agents' need for explicit state
- WIP limits prevent agent overload
- Clear task flow reduces coordination overhead
- Stage transitions trigger specific actions
- Easy to identify bottlenecks

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Smooth flow of work through the system
- Early identification of blockers
- Balanced workload across agents
- Clear visibility of system state

**How to implement this**:
```
| Backlog | Ready | In Progress | Review | Done |
|---------|-------|-------------|--------|------|
| Task 1  |       | Task 3      |        |      |
| Task 2  | Task 4| (agent-1)   | Task 5 | Task 6|
|         |       | Task 7      |        |      |
|         |       | (agent-2)   |        |      |

WIP Limits:
- In Progress: Max 1 task per agent
- Review: Max 3 tasks
- Ready: Max 5 tasks

Policies:
- Pull from Ready when In Progress < limit
- Auto-assign to specialized agents
- Human review required for Review→Done
```

**Why this works**: The board provides clear visual state that maps to agent assignments. WIP limits prevent context overload. Stage policies ensure smooth flow.

### Create Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) for Agent Consumption

**What to do**: Write detailed specifications that agents can parse and implement.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- PRDs provide complete context agents need
- Success criteria give clear completion targets
- User stories translate to test cases
- Technical requirements guide implementation
- Structured format aids pattern matching

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Agents understand what to build and why
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Reduced back-and-forth clarification
- Better alignment with business goals

**How to implement this**:
```markdown
# PRD: User Activity Dashboard

## Objective
Enable users to visualize their activity patterns over time

## User Stories
1. As a user, I want to see my daily active hours
   - Acceptance: Graph shows 24-hour activity distribution
   - Test: Verify correct hour bucketing

2. As a user, I want to export my data as CSV
   - Acceptance: Download includes all activity fields
   - Test: Verify CSV format and completeness

## Success Metrics
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- 80% of users access within first week
- Zero data discrepancies reported

## Technical Requirements
- Frontend: React with Chart.js
- Backend: REST API with pagination
- Database: PostgreSQL with indexed timestamps
- Cache: Redis for computed metrics

## Constraints
- Must work with existing authentication
- Cannot modify current database schema
- Must support 1M+ activity records per user
```

**Why this works**: The PRD provides everything an agent needs: clear objectives, measurable success criteria, technical constraints, and specific requirements. Agents can reference this throughout implementation.

### Use Parallel Development Patterns

**What to do**: Structure work so multiple agents can progress simultaneously without conflicts.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Agents cannot coordinate in real-time
- Parallel work maximizes throughput
- Clear interfaces prevent conflicts
- Fork-join patterns match agent capabilities
- Independence enables true parallelism

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Faster overall development
- Better resource utilization
- Reduced blocking between agents
- Cleaner component boundaries

**How to implement this**:
```
Fork-Join Pattern:
                ┌→ Frontend Agent
Main Task ─────┼→ Backend Agent ────→ Integration Agent → Review
                └→ Database Agent

Pipeline Pattern:
Design Agent → API Agent → Implementation Agent → Test Agent → Deploy Agent

Parallel Independent:
┌─ Feature A Agent
├─ Feature B Agent  } No dependencies
├─ Feature C Agent
└─ Documentation Agent
```

**Why this works**: Each pattern minimizes inter-agent dependencies. Fork-join allows parallel work with defined integration points. Pipeline provides clear handoffs. Independent tasks maximize parallelism.

## 6. Security Considerations

### Always Review Agent-Generated Code for Security Issues

**What to do**: Manually review all agent-generated code, especially code related to authentication, authorization, database queries, file operations, and external API calls.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Agents learn from all code in their training data, including insecure examples
- Training data contains many examples of vulnerable code patterns
- Agents cannot reliably distinguish between secure and insecure patterns
- Pattern matching works for both good and bad examples
- Agents have no built-in security awareness or risk assessment

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Approximately 30% of agent-generated authentication code contains security vulnerabilities
- Manual review catches issues that agents cannot detect
- Prevents deployment of insecure code to production systems
- Maintains security standards and compliance requirements

**Critical areas requiring review**:
```
1. Authentication and authorization:
   - Password hashing and storage
   - Session management
   - Token generation and validation
   - Permission checks

2. Database queries:
   - SQL injection vulnerabilities
   - Unvalidated user input
   - Unsafe query construction
   - Missing parameterization

3. File operations:
   - Path traversal vulnerabilities
   - Unsafe file uploads
   - Unrestricted file access
   - Missing input validation

4. External API calls:
   - Unvalidated external data
   - Unsafe deserialization
   - Missing rate limiting
   - Credential exposure

5. Cryptographic operations:
   - Weak encryption algorithms
   - Poor key management
   - Insecure random number generation
   - Missing integrity checks
```

**How to review**: Use security checklists, automated scanning tools, and manual code review by security-aware developers.

### Limit Agent Environmental Access

**What to do**: Restrict what files, directories, and commands agents can access and execute.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Agents explore systems through trial and error
- Agents have no inherent understanding of system boundaries or sensitive areas
- Unrestricted access allows agents to accidentally access sensitive files
- Agents may run dangerous commands during exploration
- No built-in safety mechanisms prevent harmful actions

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Contained agents cannot accidentally damage systems or access sensitive data
- Limits potential security breaches and data exposure
- Prevents accidental deletion or modification of critical files
- Enables safe experimentation and development

**How to implement restrictions**:
```
File system restrictions:
- Use read-only mounts for sensitive directories
- Restrict write access to specific working directories
- Block access to system directories (/etc, /root, etc.)
- Whitelist allowed file extensions and types

Command restrictions:
- Whitelist allowed commands (no rm, sudo, etc.)
- Disable network access unless required
- Prevent execution of arbitrary scripts
- Log all command attempts for review

Resource restrictions:
- Limit CPU and memory usage
- Restrict disk space consumption
- Set timeouts for long-running operations
- Monitor and alert on unusual resource usage
```

**Why restrictions work**: Agents can only access and modify resources that are explicitly allowed, preventing accidental damage or security breaches.

### Audit All Agent Actions

**What to do**: Log every action that agents take, including file reads, file writes, command executions, and API calls.

**Why this works mechanistically**: 
- Agent decision-making processes are opaque and unpredictable
- Agents may take unexpected actions during exploration
- No way to understand agent reasoning without external logging
- Logs provide the only record of what actually happened
- Debugging requires understanding the sequence of actions taken

**What practical outcome this achieves**: 
- Enables debugging when agents produce unexpected results
- Provides security audit trail for compliance and security review
- Allows identification of patterns in agent behavior
- Enables detection of unusual or potentially harmful actions

**What to log**:
```
Required logging information:
- Timestamp of every action
- Agent identity and session ID
- Action type (read, write, execute, etc.)
- Target files, directories, or commands
- Action inputs and parameters
- Action outputs and results
- Error messages and failure details
- Duration of action execution

Example log entry:
{
  "timestamp": "2024-03-15T10:30:45Z",
  "agent_id": "agent_7829",
  "session_id": "session_4401",
  "action": "file_read",
  "target": "/project/src/auth/login.js",
  "success": true,
  "duration_ms": 150,
  "tokens_consumed": 1247
}
```

**Why comprehensive logging works**: Complete logs provide visibility into agent behavior and enable effective debugging, security review, and pattern analysis.

## Summary

Effective agent usage requires understanding their fundamental cognitive architecture:

- **Stateless operation**: Agents have no memory between sessions. All important information must be preserved explicitly in files or context.

- **Pattern matching cognition**: Agents excel when current situations match training patterns (leveraging their surface and procedural knowledge). Novel situations require conceptual understanding and first-principles reasoning, which agents lack.

- **Context window limitations**: Agents have finite attention spans. Context must be managed carefully to maintain performance.

- **Probabilistic behavior**: Agents can fail randomly. Systems must be designed to handle stochastic failures gracefully.

- **Associative recall**: Agents recall explicitly stated information perfectly but struggle with implicit knowledge requiring inference.

By designing our practices around these cognitive realities rather than fighting against them, we can achieve reliable, high-performance results from agent systems. The key is to make the agent's job as easy as possible by providing clear patterns, explicit information, and well-structured environments that align with their strengths.
