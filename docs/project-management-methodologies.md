# Project Management Methodologies for Agent-Based Development

## Overview

This document explores various project management methodologies and how they apply to AI agent-based software development. The unique characteristics of agent development—rapid iteration, low cost of throwing away work, and the hybrid human-AI collaboration model—make certain approaches particularly effective.

## Key Methodologies and Artifacts

### 1. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**What it is**: Documented decisions about architectural choices, including context, decision, and consequences.

**Format**:
```markdown
# ADR-001: Use Git Worktrees for Agent Isolation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Multiple agents need to work on code simultaneously without conflicts.

## Decision
Use git worktrees to give each agent an isolated branch.

## Consequences
- Positive: Clean separation, easy merging
- Negative: Disk space usage, worktree management overhead
```

**Why it works for agents**: 
- Agents can reference ADRs for context
- Decisions are versioned and searchable
- Provides clear rationale for architectural choices

### 2. Request for Comments (RFCs)

**What it is**: Proposals for significant changes, open for team discussion before implementation.

**Format**:
```markdown
# RFC: Multi-Agent Communication Protocol

## Summary
Propose a mail-based system for inter-agent communication.

## Motivation
Agents need asynchronous, persistent communication.

## Design
- JSON files in shared directory
- Inbox/outbox pattern
- Read receipts

## Alternatives Considered
- Message queues (too complex)
- Direct RPC (synchronization issues)
```

**Why it works for agents**:
- Agents can generate RFC drafts
- Human review ensures alignment
- Creates discussion artifacts for future reference

### 3. Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)

**What it is**: Detailed specifications of what to build and why.

**Format**:
```markdown
# PRD: User Dashboard Feature

## Objective
Enable users to view activity metrics.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to see my daily activity
- As a user, I want to export my data

## Success Metrics
- Page load < 2s
- 80% user adoption

## Technical Requirements
- React frontend
- REST API
- PostgreSQL storage
```

**Why it works for agents**:
- Clear success criteria
- Decomposable into agent tasks
- Measurable outcomes

### 4. Backlog Management

**What it is**: Prioritized list of features, bugs, and tasks.

**Types**:
- **Product Backlog**: All potential work
- **Sprint Backlog**: Selected for current iteration
- **Agent Backlog**: Tasks assigned to specific agents

**Example Structure**:
```markdown
## Product Backlog
1. [P0] Fix authentication bug
2. [P1] Add user dashboard
3. [P2] Implement data export
4. [P3] Optimize performance

## Current Sprint (Week 1)
- [ ] Fix authentication bug (agent-1)
- [ ] Design dashboard API (agent-2)
- [ ] Create dashboard UI mockup (agent-3)
```

### 5. Specification Documents

**What it is**: Detailed technical specifications for implementation.

**Levels**:
- **High-level specs**: Overall architecture
- **API specs**: Endpoint definitions
- **Implementation specs**: Detailed code design

**Example API Spec**:
```yaml
endpoint: /api/dashboard/{user_id}
method: GET
authentication: Bearer token
response:
  type: object
  properties:
    widgets: array
    last_updated: timestamp
```

### 6. Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**What it is**: Write tests before implementation.

**Process for Agents**:
1. Human writes test cases
2. Agent implements to pass tests
3. Agent refactors with test safety net

**Example**:
```python
# Human writes test first
def test_user_authentication():
    response = login("user@example.com", "password")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert "token" in response.json()

# Agent implements to satisfy test
def login(email, password):
    # Implementation here
```

## Agile Methodologies for Agent Development

### Why Agile Works for Agents

1. **Cheap Iterations**: Agents can quickly try multiple approaches
2. **Rapid Feedback**: Immediate testing and validation
3. **Flexible Requirements**: Easy to pivot based on discoveries
4. **Continuous Integration**: Agents commit frequently

### Scrum Adaptation for Agents

**Roles**:
- **Product Owner**: Human stakeholder
- **Scrum Master**: Human-AI hybrid (orchestrator)
- **Development Team**: AI agents
- **Reviewers**: Human experts

**Ceremonies**:

```

### Kanban for Agent Work

**Board Structure**:
```
| Backlog | Ready | In Progress | Review | Done |
|---------|-------|-------------|--------|------|
| Task 1  |       | Task 3      |        |      |
| Task 2  | Task 4| (agent-1)   | Task 5 | Task 6|
|         |       | Task 7      |        |      |
|         |       | (agent-2)   |        |      |
```

**WIP Limits**:
- Max 2 tasks per agent
- Max 5 agents active
- Review queue < 3 items

### Extreme Programming (XP) Practices

**Applicable Practices**:
1. **Pair Programming**: Human-agent pairing
2. **Small Releases**: Frequent commits
3. **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing
4. **Refactoring**: Agents improve code iteratively
5. **Simple Design**: YAGNI principle

## Agent-Specific Adaptations

### 1. Parallel Development Patterns

**Fork-Join Pattern**:
```
Main Task
    ├── Agent 1: Frontend
    ├── Agent 2: Backend
    └── Agent 3: Tests
         ↓
    Integration Agent
```

**Pipeline Pattern**:
```
Agent 1 → Agent 2 → Agent 3 → Review
(Design)  (Implement) (Test)
```

### 2. Communication Protocols

**Structured Updates**:
```json
{
  "agent": "feature-agent-1",
  "status": "in-progress",
  "completed": ["API design", "Database schema"],
  "blocked": [],
  "next": "Implement endpoints",
  "confidence": 0.85
}
```

### 3. Task Decomposition

**Hierarchical Breakdown**:
```
Epic: E-commerce Platform
  ├── Feature: User Authentication
  │   ├── Task: Design auth flow
  │   ├── Task: Implement login API
  │   └── Task: Create login UI
  └── Feature: Product Catalog
      ├── Task: Design database
      └── Task: Build search API
```

### 4. Quality Assurance

**Multi-Layer Review**:
1. **Agent Self-Review**: Built-in validation
2. **Peer Agent Review**: Second agent checks
3. **Human Review**: Final approval
4. **Automated Testing**: CI/CD pipeline
